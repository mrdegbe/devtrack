The **default branch** is:

> ðŸ”¸ **`main`**

### Why?

* `main` (or sometimes called `master`) represents the **production-ready** codebase.
* It's the branch that new users see by default when they visit your GitHub repository.
* Your releases, deployments, and PyPI publishing should be tied to it.
